This repo consits of me trying out the popular frontend libraries and frameworks out there, to learn more about them as well as checking the developer experience.

so to go from there i will be adding more projects and will be updating this readme file as i go.

The steps are listed below.

Step 1
Google the popular frontend applications and frameworks for building web applications

as per the survey from stack overflow, the most popular frontend frameworks are:

--> 1) React
    2) Angular
    3) Vue 
    4) svelte
    6) preact
    7) solid js


i kept preact in the list from my personal interest, as it is light weight and it is an alternative to the react as they mention it. so i wanted to check it out.
